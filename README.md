<h1>Instructions on how to play</h1>
There are two wizards that are going against each other. Wizard1, which is the wizard on the left side of the screen, uses the keys AWSD to move around and the spacebar to shoot red lasers. Wizard2, which is the wizard on the right side of the screen, uses the arrow keys to move around and the comma key to shoot green lasers. The goal for both wizards is to shoot their enemy and decrease their health in order to win. Wizard1 will win when the health of Wizard2 is decreased to 0, and vice versa. Make sure to be quick enough to dodge the lasers as much as you can and win the game. Good luck!
